## Description

Modern Continuum Mechanics is an upcoming area of research which is utilised in certain novel areas of science such as biophysics, biomechanics, crystal plasticity et cetera. With the emergence of modern open source codes and softwares implementing these problems into real world analysis becomes much easier, given lesser assumptions and more accuracy

This course is intended to approach certain problems in biology using the celebrated [Cahn-Hilliard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahn%E2%80%93Hilliard_equation) and [Allen-Cahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen%E2%80%93Cahn_equation) equations implemented computational using Finite Element Methods and specifically [deal.II](http://www.dealii.org/)

## Assessment

This course has been assigned 3 credits for the Summer of 2018. 

## Topics

* Finite Element Method 
* Continuum Mechanics
* Introduction to Biophysics
* Programming using C++
* Implementation of deal.ii for scientific programming 
* Phase field modelling
* Literature Review

## Tutorials

* [Introduction to Finite Element Method](https://open.umich.edu/find/open-educational-resources/engineering/introduction-finite-element-methods)
* [Lectures on Continuum Physics](https://open.umich.edu/find/open-educational-resources/engineering/lectures-continuum-physics)

## Scope 

This course aims at addressing certain key problems in biology with the help of Cahn-Hilliard equations and implementing them using deal.ii. Another major feature is the multiphysics coupled problems which are solved numerically using the finite element method and applied to a wide spectrum of biological and chemical problems. 

## Code of Conduct

Please treat this lab like a modern professional work environment:

* All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience
  including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery
  is not appropriate for any event.
  
* Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other students.

* Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or
  exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.

* Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual
  orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion,
  sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking,
  following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks
  or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
  attention.

* Diversity is a source of strength, creativity, and innovation. All students
  in this course are expected to value the contributions of each person and
  respect the ways in which their identity, culture, background, experience,
  status, abilities, and opinion enrich our learning experience and university
  community.

* Disrespectful behavior or comments directed toward any group or individual
  will be addressed by the instructor.

* Academic Integrity is critical to the mission of the University of
  Wisconsin-Madison, a research institution with high academic standards and
  rigor. All members of the University community play a role in fostering an
  environment in which student learning is achieved in a fair, just, and
  honest way.
   
## Additional Resources
    
* The [Greater University Tutoring Service (GUTS)](http://www.guts.wisc.edu/)
  is a Registered Student Organization (RSO) supported by segregated fees and
  dedicated to connecting UW students with volunteer tutors for assistance
  with academic courses, study skills, conversational English, and
  intercultural exchange. We provide free tutoring and mentoring to hundreds
  of students and university affiliates each semester!

* [Tutoring-by-Request
  (TBR)](https://www.engr.wisc.edu/academics/student-services/ulc/tutoring-by-request/)
  is a privately funded program that allows authorized students to obtain
  one-on-one help from tutors for a number of different courses. Typically TBR
  provides tutors for over 60 courses engineering students commonly take.

* [UHS mental health providers](https://www.uhs.wisc.edu/mental-health/)
  understand the complexities of student life and offer an open, safe, and
  confidential environment to help students through issues that may interfere
  with their well-being, academic productivity, and happiness.
